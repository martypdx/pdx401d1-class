# Week 2

## feedback

* people like coding challenge, suggestion to put on whiteboard for "early start". 
_Instructor concern: make sure we have enough time for day's topic._

* Group flow - got confused, lost relevancy (tangents). _Supplemental 
information intentional, please be willing to regulate flow._

* Syllabus/Relavancy
    * always a challenge, will continue to provide reference point.
    * will create canvas modules and calendar events
    * getting readings and topics aligned
